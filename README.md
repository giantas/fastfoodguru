FastFood Guru

The Idea: Yelp is a pretty popular source of restaurant reviews. However, most people use it to learn about restaurants they have never heard about before. What about massive fast-food chains like McDonald’s and Burger King? Plenty of people go to these, but somehow, they are not a popular review candidate.

Yes, you might tell me that every menu is pretty much the same, and the food always tastes the same as well. However, if you visited many of these chain “restaurants”, you know there are a few things that differ wildly.

Which one has the most luxurious bathroom? Which ones mark up their menu prices? Which ones have funny drunks at 1AM in the morning? This would be a review site for those fast-food chains that are supposedly consistent.
